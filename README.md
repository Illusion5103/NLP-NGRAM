# NLPProject

Natural language processing program written in Python. Using Ngrams, it can help identify the language a text document is written in by creating a histogram of ngrams for various languages, essentially creating a fingerprint for that language. A user can compare Ngram histograms of known languages to the Ngram histogram of an unknown language in order to determine what language the mystery language is. Included are 6 text documents in known languages, and 1 in a mystery language. The histograms the program provides for the known languages can be used to identify the origin of the mystery language.
